# ðŸ§® Client-Server-Calculator-App

This project implements a **menu-driven calculator** using **Client-Server architecture** with **Java Sockets**. It allows two-way communication between a client and a server, where the client sends arithmetic operation requests, and the server processes them and returns the result.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Performs basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (integer)
- Menu-driven user interface
- Socket communication using `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream`
- Error-handling for invalid choices and division by zero
- Server remains active until client exits

## ðŸ§  Concepts Used

### 1. Java Sockets
- `Socket`: Used by the client to initiate a connection to the server.
- `ServerSocket`: Used by the server to listen for incoming connections on a specific port.

### 2. Data Streams
- `DataInputStream` / `DataOutputStream`: Allow sending and receiving of primitive data types like `int` between client and server.

### 3. Client-Server Communication
- The client connects to the server via a socket and sends operation code and numbers.
- The server processes the request based on the operation and returns the result.
- Both programs continue running until an exit command is issued.

### 4. Scanner
- Used to take input from the user on the client side.
